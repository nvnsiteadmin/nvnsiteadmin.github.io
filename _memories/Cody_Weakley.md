Most of the world will never know how much we all lost on August 4, 2021. Nguu Van Nguyen, Papa, was possibly one of the kindest, most patient, and most loving people that I've ever met. As I struggle through this difficult time, I am reminded of Nguu's wisdom, "what can you do?" Luckily in this case I can share some of my experiences of Nguu.

Born on a vietnemese river boat into a large family, Nguu gracefully navigated a life full of challenge. He told me that he had shared shoes with his brother and always how he was grateful to have the opportunity of the education that he would advance with. He was an excellent at swimming, fishing, poetry, research, botany, and always an updated scholar. His work brought food and hope that improved the quality of countless lives, truly, benefitting the world's people.

I think my favorite part of Papa was his stories though, he always had an excellent story from his many adventures ready to engage our small crowds.  There's many to choose from, but I think my favorite is the story of a rainy ride in jungle with his driver, who suddenly stopped in the middle of the road, jumps out to retrieve a large machete from his trunk, and then proceeds to dispatch a rather large snake (with another passerby) from the middle of the dark jungle road.  Nguu would laugh and say, "snake is very good to eat" but in a way like it was just another type of steak. His life was so full of these wonderous stories and I think that's why he was always able to help when any of us needed guidance; because in reality he'd already been through worse, but his wisdom would always be humble.

Nguu and I were born in very different cultures and on complete opposites of the world. I met Nguu when he came to visit Le Mai in Bloomington, Indiana after she graduated with her undergraduate math degree at Indiana University.  After dating Le Mai for several months, Nguu wanted to meet me, so he invited me to come have dinner, where he prepared a delicious steak dinner like he'd done it a million times before.  Without skipping a beat, he treated me like we'd been friends for my entire life, and he was so funny and different from anyone that I knew. I felt accepted into his family far before Le Mai and I actually tied the knot, I can never thank him enough for that gift.

When Nguu slipped away from us Wednesday evening, I could only think that Le Mai, Leona, and I had spoken with him that morning. We all told him how much we loved him and how proud we were of him. Leona had requested a bowl of her favorite "rectangle" rice noodle and pho soup.  I will never forget how much Nguu smiled as he saw Leona stuffing her face.  That's how I will always remember him, happy, surrounded, and so in love with his family.

To papa, I love you and will miss you greatly, I can promise our family will continue to honor you and your wisdom for the years to come. Please rest well.
