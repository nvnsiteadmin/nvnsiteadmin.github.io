We have so many memories together. Nguu and I even have more to remember, especially when we lived and worked in Rome. I pray that Nguu's spirit will soon return to eternity. The rest of us in the world, we also try to live happily with the rest of our family, especially our children and grandchildren.
Wishing Elvie a lot of strength to overcome this difficult situation.
Personal and warm regards.
