We will miss you very much, Nguu! You shone. You were always humble and caring, putting others first, serving with joy. You were a delight to be with. Your friendship was a treasure. Thank you very much, Nguu. Thank you for opening the gate for us excitedly,	 for welcoming us warmly to your garden and your home, for sharing interesting stories and brilliant insights, for your gentle ways, for sharing Sikhay/Sarap moments, for introducing us to fresh outlooks and delicious possibilities in food and nutrition, and life. Mai and I, and our vibrant senior citizen group, were blessed to have spent precious moments with you and Elvie. We will always cherish those. You enriched our lives.
You will always be fondly remembered, Nguu. We thank God for you!

I will always remember Nguu's radiant face and beaming smiles. The goodness of his heart shone through. He was joyful - in the way he spoke and related with people. He was kind and courteous. He was brilliant but never arrogant. He saw life and the world with eyes of appreciation and gratitude. He was giving. He was a  gentle soul. Thank you, Nguu, for the love you showered on Elvie. You were an honorable and gentle husband. Thank you, Nguu, for the laughter and the inspiration. Thank you for the gift of yourself.   I will always remember you in the garden. I will propagate mint and basil, sawtooth, kefir lime and rau ram, in memory of you. You gave food and friendship a different flavor - something to be savored, Sarap that is always remembered. Go to the light now, Nguu! You deserve the warmest welcome in your eternal garden. You know, Nguu, I cried buckets...But I ended up smiling and thanking the Lord for you.
