 We have known Nguu for over forty-five years during our time in IRRI, IITA and even after retirement. He was truly special in so many ways. As a colleague in IITA, he expressed himself well in reports and in meetings, and his interventions were timely and assertive. He was very intelligent, sharp, clear minded and straight forward and at the same time, unassuming. He was particularly good at documenting and timely publishing of his research results.

During our years together in IITA, we were also neighbours and our families got close. We would often have dinners at each other’s houses and our kids would play together. Once we left IITA and moved to Canada, we still maintained our association through work meetings and during visits to the Philippines, when we made sure to meet with the family and occasionally stayed overnight with them. We were fortunate to have done so during our last visit to the Philippines in early 2020, prior to the COVID pandemic. We have pleasant memories of our stay, and spending valuable time learning more about Nguu’s achievements and accomplishments as well as those of Elvie’s and their children, Le Kim, Le Ann and Le Mai and their families. 


Nguu was a wonderful man and sadly, he has left us far too soon. May his soul rest in peace.
