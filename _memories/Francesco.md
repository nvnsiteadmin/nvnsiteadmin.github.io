Goodbye Nguu, farewell papa. I will miss your smiles, so big and beautiful, for your grandchildren. I will miss your care in preparing and serving rice for all of us. And I will miss our chats about life and your positive attitude about new things. Good men like you plant strong seeds. The colourful garden you left behind will continue to bear fruit, through the generations. Fly free and in peace. We will not disturb you.
