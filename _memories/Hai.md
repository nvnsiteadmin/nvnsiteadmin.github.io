Goodbye my uncle. In Vietnam, my family always misses you. Due to the pandemic we were not able to come to you in the last moments of your life. Your memory will stay in my heart forever. Especially, I will never forget your smile every time you visited my family in Vietnam. The last time you came back to Vietnam, when Be Ha was born in Hoc Mon hospital, Be Ha also had the opportunity to see you. Please go back to your ancestors in heaven.

There are so many things to remember about my uncle. Right now, it's bubbling up inside of me. It's like a slow motion movie these days.

The thing that I will never forget is that he visited Vietnam on the day I went to my future wife's house to prepare for our marriage. At that time, I considered him like a father because my father had died before 2 years ago. Besides, He and I had a trip to visit Cu Chi Tunnels. A trip by bus in Vietnam.
