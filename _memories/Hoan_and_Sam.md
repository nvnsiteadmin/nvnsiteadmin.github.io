Hoan just received an email from Mr. Dat saying that Mr. Nguu has passed on. Mr. Nguu, you andthe people you love -- Mr. Vinh, Ms. Dat, Mr. Ton That Trinh -- have left this world. We will no longer receive poems, short articles, that you write. Not to forget the indescribably delicious chicken cabbage salad that Hoan had eaten many times in Rome. Mr. Sam tried it over and over, still it wasn't as delicious as you did. 

May you rest in peace Mr. Nguu. 

With our sincere condolences to the family,

--- Hoan

To say that the news is an unexpected shock is an understatement.

We always cherish the time we stayed at your apartment when we first came to Rome for Hoan to pick up her job at FAO.

He picked us up at San Anselmo hotel to come and stay at your place when we were looking for an apartment to rent...
 
Nguu and I we cooked together, played guitar and sung together...
I’m sure your strength and stamina will help you and your children overcome this painful challenge of life and living.

To share with you a personal feeling: I’m quite stressed with everything that is going on at the moment in the world, unenlightened people, politicians, unintelligent and inhuman acts and deeds... Age and unwanted medical conditions are also catching up on us...
 

May Nguu rest in peace. We shall miss him dearly. The world has lost another rice expert...
May each passing day brings a much needed blessing to all of us.
