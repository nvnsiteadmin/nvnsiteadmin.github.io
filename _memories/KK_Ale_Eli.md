Hi Lolo. I start with hi because I dont like using dear. It sounds too formal and it doesn't fit my relationship with you. Id rather be personal and friendly, because you were my personal hero. I have vivid memories of the time i spent with you and Lola in the Philippines when I was four.  Do you remember the times we went to the market together? Or when you taught me how to write my own name on the blackboard outside? I do. I remember it well. I remember your fried eggs that were cooked with onion and the omelette sandwiches you made. I remember how every meal there had to be some form of soup before you were satisfied. I remember the shrimp chips you bought and I remember the times we watched soap operas with Lola. I remember the time i had pneumonia and you took care of me. Got me to walk with that darn iv attached and how you would smile. The laugh you had when you made a joke. The times you would randomly start singing or playing your harmonica. The time you tried to fix my glasses with a toothpick. All the times I caught you sitting at your desk working, and would silently watch for a bit before going to do things. The times you picked me up from school or when we were in Germany and you brought a bacon flavoured chips packet to the store to look for he exact same kind. The Times when I was small and you picked me up and carried me in your arms. The Times you comforted me when i cried because I missed my mama. The Times you would look over my shoulder while I was drawing, and I'd look over your's when you drew. You drew so well. I remember the land card of Europe you drew for me. It's still hanging in my room. I remember hearing you fought a snake for me, and when I called you superman. I remember you waking me up in the morning by knocking on my window and telling me I sleep too much. I remember when we went on a bike like ride and Lola and I were in the carriage that you peddled for us. I remember the Vietnamese dinners you'd prepare. How big your smile was at that one German restaurant when they pulled out the roast pork. How happy you were in your garden. The way you walked. The small phrases you would use like "use your coconut" and "better that we wait for the bus than the bus waits for us"  spicy toothpaste you would use to wake up in the morning. Watching you take your afternoon naps. I have many more memories, and each one brings a smile to my face and tears in my eyes. I love you, Lolo. And I miss you. You're dreaming a long dream now. And you deserve the rest. I hope it's a good one. I'll forever treasure the times we spent together. And you will never be forgotten, superman. Lots of love, hugs and kisses,  KK. 


Okay, well that's long. Not sure if it's good but I just spilled my emotions out here so it better be

I love you Lolo. I am having fun with my dolls and I am eating everything here. I play with my cousins and made new friends. I wish you will be good and that you will keep playing music. I love you very much. Also, I now know how to write my name.

Dear Lolo, I want that you also don't cry and these words are only for you. Do you know that we are thinking a lot about you? You were a good grandpa. Lolo I made new friends here. I love you so much.
