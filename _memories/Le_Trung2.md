My dearest friend Nguu,

It was very painful getting the news that you had left us forever a couple of days ago. Everybody knows that you were a very productive scientist, bilingual writer and poet; Above all, you will be remembered as a very caring and loving husband and father!

I want to let you know that our precious moments we shared together will never fade in my memory. Now that you are in heaven, you have ample time to enjoy with your parents, Nanay and your loved ones including Le Van, thay Trinh, anh Tung, Vinhâ€¦ there! I definitely will meet you there one of these days, my friend Nguu!


So rest in peace my dearest friend Nguu!
