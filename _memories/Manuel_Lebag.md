It is a sad news for all his friends and family that day when he left us to join our Lord and Savior Jesus and Father God. I will always remember Tito Nguu's good advises and reminders about respect for our parents whenever we visit their house. He was always hospitable, generous and loving to friends and families and relatives. I know he is happy now together with our Lord and dearly departed loved ones.
