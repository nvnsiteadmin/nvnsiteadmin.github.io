Because grandpa Nguu, you stay so far away, so I rarely meet you and your family. I live in Vietnam, and you live in the Philipines. I saw you and grandma when you visited 2 years ago, and I always remember that. I really want to see you if I could. But I think I can't now, I'm so sad. I am so disappointed myself. I will try to study hard, I make efforts to study, and will make my parents proud of me. I always miss you, my grandpa I love.
