 Ngưu and me, besides some short gatherings, had three long periods with nearby living:

 1) At Sai-Gon Agricultural University 1966-1070 in the School's Dormitory.  Four years with numerous evenings and 1001 talks on earth, we called it "enlarged gossip".

 2) At UP Los-Banos 1971-1974, from Vietnam to the Philippines, on the same flight were Ngưu-Tịnh-Xuân-Hiền.  For more than 3 years, every late afternoon, we played volley-ball and tossed "street-style" Vietnamese words, without fear of being blamed by other people!  Again, 1001 life stories and talks over the years.  In mid-1974, I returned to Vietnam; Nguu and another younger friend saw me off at the Manila Airport...

3) At Quezon City 1980-1991 when I took coursework at UP Diliman, only 2 km from Nguu's residence.  Every 2 or 3 weeks, I came to see Ngưu; and 2 bottles of beer, divided into 1.5+0.5 (I took the less for weaker dose), and again 1001 stories in the world...  Afterwards in 1992-1993 IRRI Los-Banos and Ngưu went abroad for work, so fewer meetings...

 
In 2016, I was in Los-Banos for the SEARCA's 50-year Ceremony, I met many friends of the old Los-Banos time (1970's and 1990's).  The last day before returning to Vietnam, I went to Manila, stayed at Ngưu's home, was brought to go around the city and and to visit my old U.P Diliman.  Next morning at 4 A.M, Ngưu went with me to Nino Aquino Airport (he did not drive due to poor eyesight) for a second seeing off.  I did not expect that it was the last time with Ngưu, but it is now...

Retrieving old pictures with lot of souvenirs, I realize something... Over the years, old friends did not have a single call; just 1-2 emails generally.  Maybe we are still affected by old happenings: One post letter took one month to arrive;  a 3-minute phone call costed 18 USD!  Maybe with old age we forget internet... When alive and gathering together, we are happy; but "out of sight out of mind" until someone passed away, then "Sincere Condolences".  Same case with our friends Ly Tung... R.I.P Tung and Nguu.

Thus I am trying to remedy... Every week I shall call a friend (throughViber, Skype, etc), of course if he/she agreed to talk, and "tám888" (Vietnamese for gossip of everything, not only people);  at too old ages, we won't talk of businesses.  Going around 5-10 persons, then in about 3 months, we come back again to the same friend.
