With this photo, we should like to remember a good friend and ex- FAO colleague who passed yesterday morning. Nguu Van Nguyen, PhD (extreme left in photo) was FAO's rice expert in AGP and served as secretary of the International Rice Commission. He was also a poet, and a loving father to 3 children. He and his wife Elvira Liwag, PhD journeyed with us to start OFSPES in Rome and here in the Philippines where they settled upon retirement. We have a project group called SIKHAY where we promote food security and nutrition awareness and Elvie and Nguu are active there. Nguu you will be missed but will always be remembered. To Le Anh, Le Kim and Trina and Le Mai your father was a gentleman and a good gardener - we will miss him. Our sincere condolences from OFSPES and Sikhay and from Tina and me. May he rest in peace.
