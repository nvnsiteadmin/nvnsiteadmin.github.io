Tens of years living far away from Vietnam
This morning suddenly I missed and saw in my dream the Perfume River
And the paper boat that I set afloat on the River
In an autumn festival of my childhood

The boat that carried my childhood smile
I wonder where is it now?
But I always embrace it tightly along my life 
Oh the paper boat and the river of yesterday
