I can still remember thinking 
With a feeling of peace and belonging 
Home is the place where you feel in control 
Home isn’t a place, it’s a feeling
 
You can be miles away and still be at home 
By reading your favorite childhood book 
A feeling of home will grab your heart 
And you feel most comfortable and smart
