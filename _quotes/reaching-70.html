Reaching 50, people consider themselves old, but at 70, I still feel young. In the morning I sweep the garden, watering the plants if there was no rain in the previous day, tender and plant herbs, and flower plants. Other daily activities include listening to news and music from radio and television, searching the internet for news and mails from children, friends, and colleagues. In some days I help in cleaning the house. In the evening, I watch the moon while consuming a glass of beer. 

Being young is beautiful, but being old is comfortable, I thought!
