A home could be a concrete building \
But a home isn’t a place, it’s a feeling \
It is a refuge for the weary soul \
When you come home to tuck under the covers of a cozy bed
 
Home is place of comfort and happiness \
Far from being stuck in a cold woodshed \
Home doesn't necessarily to be a specific place \
It is where you want to stay
 
I can still remember thinking \
With a feeling of peace and belonging \
Home is the place where you feel in control \
Home isn’t a place, it’s a feeling
 
You can be miles away and still be at home \
By reading your favorite childhood book \
A feeling of home will grab your heart \
And you feel most comfortable and smart
