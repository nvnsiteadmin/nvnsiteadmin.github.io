Oh Hue, let's say farewell.\
Months and years of tender childhood,\
And the rapidly passing teenage years,\
Hue had cuddled, Hue had embraced me,\
With the clean and fresh water of Huong Giang,\
With songs and sounds of kite flutes, of rustling pine trees\
Mixed with the sound of the ho from the ferries. \
Truong Tien Bridge filled with ao dai Dong Khanh girls, \
On the way back home in the afternoon, pedaling,\
Then in the cool autumn evenings\
No one tell, but steps increased in speed,\
And the long winter days with north wind drizzles.\
The bitter cold, freezes one's feet,\
Would pass though slowly, as they might\
Return to Hue, the blue sky,\
With birdsongs and blooming flowers of spring,\
Then summer arrives Phuong flowers reddened the walking paths,\
Of Quoc Hoc campus.

Tell me Hue, to never forget\
Le Loi, Dong Ba, Gia Hoi,\
And the small quarter that gets flooded every year,\
Even ill-fitting shirts were difficult to obtain\
they protect me from the strong cold winds. \
In winter afternoons,\
On the banks of Huong Giang, alone waiting \
For the sound of Father's boat, arriving\
Or the evening, under the thatch roof, longing\
For Mother, from the market returning,\
Why does it close so late?\
For anxiety filled my young, whole heart ,\
Tell me Hue, please tell me\
Huong Giang, will water be ever clear and fresh\
So, the Dong Cat Fish up the river to reach Dai Dau\
Make the evening meal delicious?

Tell me Hue, please tell me\
One should hurry\
So as not to miss the Trung Tien Bridge\
At the appointed time for the date\
At Van Lau gate\
So that there would be no heart broken.\

Do say farewell.\
Promised not to be sad.\
But why would tears run in creases\
When gray clouds fall on the way to the airport?
