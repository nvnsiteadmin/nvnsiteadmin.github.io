Life is to get up in the morning \
When it is bright in the garden \
Shining, the sun creates happiness \
The air is fresh \
The plants are healthily green \
After a night of rest 

 
Get up in the morning and be occupied as best \
Fill what's empty and empty what's full \
Polish the dull side and shine up the bright side \
Expect nothing and not be taken by surprise \
Without challenges life is not worthwhile 
 

Life is a process of becoming \
To be alive is a grand thing \
There are many nights as days \
In life there are moments of happiness \
And also moments of sadness 
 

Eases the blows with a laughter \
 For it is a good shock absorber \
Continue to struggle and hang around \
Be inspired by love and gratefulness \
For love relieves the loneliness \
And appreciation enhances the happiness 
 

Let knowledge be the guide \
Pass dreams into actions \
And embrace results of actions into new dream \
There is always tomorrow \
The sun is shinning, the wind is breezing \
It is a pleasant morning
