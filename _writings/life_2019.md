#### Part 1

I am dreaming, a long dream \
Please do not disturb, lives around me \
When youthfully green young leaves \
Flowing over my body \
When shining sun rays \
Slowly enter my soul \
Warming life up as it may \
Soft breezes fully fill my heart. \
I hear, the sound of lively life \
Moving up to stars in sky \
I hear, from my every own soul \
Love has given a beautiful birth \
Please do not disturb \
Lives around me \
I am feeling young again \
Please do not disturb as you can 

#### Part 2

Life is to get up in the morning \
The sun shows up now and then \
It is bright in our garden \
The air is fresh \
The plants are healthily green \
After a night of rest \
Shining the sun creates happiness \
It is quite a pleasant morning


Life is to get up in the morning \
When it is bright in the garden \
Shining, the sun creates happiness \
Get up in the morning and be occupied as best \
Fill what's empty and empty what's full \
Polish the dull side and shine up the bright side \
Expect nothing and not be taken by surprise \
Without challenges life is not worthwhile 


Life is a process of becoming \
To be alive is a grand thing \
There are many nights as days \
In life there are moments of happiness \
And moments of sadness \
Eases the blows with a laughter \
For it is a good shock absorber \
Continue to struggle and hang around


Life is to get up in the morning \
Be inspired by love and gratefulness \
For love relieves the loneliness \
And appreciation enhances the happiness \
Let knowledge be the guide \
Pass dreams into actions \
And embrace results of actions into new dream \
There is always tomorrow
