 Crazy, crazy, I am singing loudly,\
No sound around,\
I will be dead.

How many cigarettes have been burned? \
Why is there no smoke yet?\
I sleep soundly thus I forget, \
the dream of spring.

Yes, love is disturbing,\
But cuong si, I will forever be cuong cuong si.\
Thirty years old, I am just growing up,\
because of loving.\
I am throwing away all my work.

Wind is beating on the window,\
Or are waves beating in my heart?\
Birds are singing the sad songs,\
Or are you saying the missing words?

I am drawing the skyline with folds,\
If you were there at the end,\ 
I will see you and my missing will fade away.

Oh, dear, you are my breath,\
But my country is my life origin.\
I don't want to lose any-\
It is too painful to lose.

Then my dear, my breath.\
don't let the tears disturb your beautiful eyes,\
Since the stars will be sad and angry\
when clouds cover the sky.

Far away from you, I am hurt.
