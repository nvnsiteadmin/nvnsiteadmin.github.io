Tens of years living far away from Vietnam \
This morning suddenly I missed and saw in my dream the Perfume River \
And the paper boat that I set afloat on the River \
In an autumn festival of my childhood 


The boat that carried my childhood smile \
I wonder where is it now? \
But I always embrace it tightly along my life \
Oh the paper boat and the river of yesterday 


Far a way I always see them  \
As they have always been mine \
In moments of happiness, moment of sadness \
The paper boat and the river of childhood always shine 
 

Oh! I missed you now \
The Perfume River and the childhood paper boat
