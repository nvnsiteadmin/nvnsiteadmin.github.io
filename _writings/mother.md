Your love is vast as the Pacific, gracefully warm. \
Your love is so sweet as the gentle stream, earnestly sweet.\
Your song is as soft as the sound of the evening rice field, murmuring,\
Rocking me to sleep in the moonlit veranda, till late at night,\
My beloved mother.

Your love is full as the full moon, smiling.\
Your love is just as gentle as the wind, caressing the surface of the lake.\
Your song the kite flute sound, was now and then, sauntering.\
Sun, rains, fogs, you are around.

How many nights, many sleepless nights full of anxiety\
You could relax only when I am fast asleep. \
Work late into the night, wake up early in the morning.\
Twice to the market daily, just to raise me up.

Winter rains, summer suns, cold   and heat, you never complain. \
Your hair turns gray too fast due to cold evening fogs,\
and fiercely hot sun rays, you never look sad,\
But always contented watching me grow up.

Dear Mother, \
Your song accompanying me to sleep in my childhood, will I ever forget?
