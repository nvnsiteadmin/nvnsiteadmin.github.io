It rains, it rains \
In this Sunday morning \
On the way home from church, we keep on walking \
Holding your slender and long fingers 

 
On the way to Crossing \
Pin a rose to your dark and long hair \
For the whole life, I will take a good care \
Yes, a good care of you, with my warm heart 


It is cloudy, thousand floating clouds \
The clouds touch your floating hair \
Picking up the rose, probably you were in doubt \
Letting it idle in your lovely palms 

 
To the park, we are on our way \
Why is it so long this Sunday? \
Take care of you, I will for whole life \
Though I am feverishly mad with you now 

 
On the way to your boarding house \
You pick up the forgotten rose and pressing to your lips \
Rocking you to sleep \
I will for whole life, till hairs turn gray
