Watching the autumn, arriving \
Outside the window of the dormitory, leaves falling \
And the sun is shining in the campus pathways, \
Wishing love will always last.

Alone this autumn, \
Bare hands regretfully forget to embrace dreams, \
In the cold night, as moon swallows the sky, \
Loneliness blurs one's mind.

The autumn winds are coming, \
And leaves are falling, \
Winds kiss the floating hair, \
Why oceans, all but empty.

In this autumn evening, golden sunshine\
Then the clouds suddenly cover the Los Banos sky, \
Steps forget the way to her house.

Evenings were so short in the park. \
How many autumns have passed? \
Have gone with the winds? \
Carried with them, into the past\
Memory and dreams of the early years.
