Tinawagan ko po si Ate at sabi nya pupunta daw sya dyan sa Sunday, kaya tatawagan ko na lang po si Ate sa Sunday para makausap ko din po kayo.

			<p>Most of the world will never know how much we all lost on August 4, 2021. Nguu Van Nguyen, Papa, was possibly one of the kindest, most patient, and most loving people that I’ve ever met. As I struggle through this difficult time, I am reminded of Nguu’s wisdom, “what can you do?” Luckily in this case I can share some of my experiences of Nguu.</p>

		<div id="excerpt">
			<p>We will sorely miss Nguu…our OFPSES and SIKHAY meetings will not be the same without him. Together with Nguu and Elvie, Tito and Lou, we have all journeyed together since the early 2007 to start OFSPES in Rome and later  in Manila which led to our starting the LSE program in Rome in 2008 for our migrants. Then when we all settled back in retirement in Manila a few years later, together with Te, Rome, Dodgie and Mai and Maris, we got introduced to the world of herbs that we had never before tasted or even heard of with such exotic names as rau ram, and kaffir lime – thanks to Nguu and Elvie through the cooking delights in their home where  they always welcomed us. They got us all hooked into discovering this whole new world of enhancing our foods while benefiting from added health and nutrition. It also started us on our adventures into cooking and trying all sorts of recipes incorporating various herbs and veggies and then into transforming these into lovely calendars that we could sell and give away as gifts. Elvie was the chef among us all, and Nguu was the master gardener who made planting seem all so easy and which inspired us to start planting our herbs and veggies as well.  He was always ready to share the seeds or seedlings that he had at home. Nguu was always the quiet one in the ever-boisterous group in our never-ending regular meetings that were more often excuses to partake of the Nguyens’ delicious concoctions than pursuing our objective of producing our not-so-annual calendars. It was Nguu however who was keen for the group to pursue and produce  a cookbook and he would say that we need not be perfectionists about it but that we should just put it together as our group’s contribution to advocating more vegetable and herb consumption in the Filipino diet.  Each time we would arrive in the Nguyen home, he would often already be waiting for us at the gate to welcome us with his warm smile. On behalf  of  OFSPES and Sikhay we will really miss Nguu and we would like to extend our deepest sympathies to Elvie, Le Anh and Francesco and the kids, Le Kim and Trina and Le Mai and family.   Incidentally I informed the FAO retirees in FB  and some  31 (mixed nationalities) would like to extend their condolences as most of them remember Nguu’s writings in the FAO Staff Coop Gazette. So Nguu,  Chin-chin, Salut, Cheers and Kampai.</p><p>Tina and Edgar</p>

			<p>Noong gabing namaalam si Nguu, naisulat ko sa twitter na “kahapon ,nabawasan ng isang mabuting tao ang mundo.” Nagulat ako sa reaksiyon sa twitter. Siguro dahil kakaunti na ang mabuting tao. Halos 100 ang naglike, maraming nagcomment at nakiramay.</p><p>Totoong mabuting tao si Nguu at nagpapasalamat ako sa Diyos na siya ang napangasawa ni Elvie. Foreigner siya pero hindi naramdaman ng pamilya ang kaibahan niya sa Filipino. Vietnamese kaya katulad ng Filipino ang panlasa sa pagkain. Matulungin siya at halos lahat kami sa  kanyang  Filipino family ay natulungan niya at binigyan ng pagkakataon.</p>

As a colleague in IITA, he expressed himself well in reports and in meetings, and his interventions were timely and assertive. He was very intelligent, sharp, clear minded and straight forward and at the same time, unassuming. He was particularly good at documenting and timely publishing of his research results.</p>

		<div id="excerpt">
			<p>Hi Lolo. I start with hi because I dont like using dear. It sounds too formal and it doesn’t fit my relationship with you. Id rather be personal and friendly, because you were my personal hero. I have vivid memories of the time i spent with you and Lola in the Philippines when I was four.  Do you remember the times we went to the market together? Or when you taught me how to write my own name on the blackboard outside? I do. I remember it well. I remember your fried eggs that were cooked with onion and the omelette sandwiches you made. I remember how every meal there had to be some form of soup before you were satisfied. I remember the shrimp chips you bought and I remember the times we watched soap operas with Lola. I remember the time i had pneumonia and you took care of me. Got me to walk with that darn iv attached and how you would smile. The laugh you had when you made a joke. The times you would randomly start singing or playing your harmonica. The time you tried to fix my glasses with a toothpick. All the times I caught you sitting at your desk working, and would silently watch for a bit before going to do things. The times you picked me up from school or when we were in Germany and you brought a bacon flavoured chips packet to the store to look for he exact same kind. The Times when I was small and you picked me up and carried me in your arms. The Times you comforted me when i cried because I missed my mama. The Times you would look over my shoulder while I was drawing, and I’d look over your’s when you drew. You drew so well. I remember the land card of Europe you drew for me. It’s still hanging in my room. I remember hearing you fought a snake for me, and when I called you superman. I remember you waking me up in the morning by knocking on my window and telling me I sleep too much. I remember when we went on a bike like ride and Lola and I were in the carriage that you peddled for us. I remember the Vietnamese dinners you’d prepare. How big your smile was at that one German restaurant when they pulled out the roast pork. How happy you were in your garden. The way you walked. The small phrases you would use like “use your coconut” and “better that we wait for the bus than the bus waits for us”  spicy toothpaste you would use to wake up in the morning. Watching you take your afternoon naps. I have many more memories, and each one brings a smile to my face and tears in my eyes. I love you, Lolo. And I miss you. You’re dreaming a long dream now. And you deserve the rest. I hope it’s a good one. I’ll forever treasure the times we spent together. And you will never be forgotten, superman. Lots of love, hugs and kisses,  KK.</p><p>Okay, well that’s long. Not sure if it’s good but I just spilled my emotions out here so it better be</p><p>— KK</p>

		<div id="excerpt">
			<p>In so many ways, Papa feels like a person who was larger than life. He defied so many odds and in so doing raised himself out of poverty and helped his family do the same. Although he was a small man, he knew how to fill a space. His work brought him across the world and his openness and curiosity helped him experience it fully. Most of all, he had a vision of what he wanted for himself, and the temerity and singlemindedness to pursue it. He lived a unique life, and thanks to him, so did we.</p><p>Although I’ve known my father for 42 years, it’s clear that there are many parts of him that I can never truly know: his childhood in Hue, a place I have not yet even seen, his love for his friends around the world, his writing and his work, and the breadth of the social impact he has had.</p>

			<p>My dearest friend Nguu,</p><p>It was very painful getting the news that you had left us forever a couple of days ago. Since then, I have been spending my time talking about you and the good time we shared while in the UPLB with Mai, Bui Xuan and anh Brian Ngo over the phone. I also enjoyed reading the very first poem showing your love and admiration to your very dear Elvie and tributes written by our friends; those written statements really warmed my heart. I thought it would be easy to recall our precious time together, both happy and sad!- but it is rather tough thinking that this will be the last time I am talking to you, my friend Nguu!</p>

			<p>Buong maghapon akong nasa tapat ng laptop halos, nagtatapos ng mga requirements sa darating na semestre. Mag-aalas diyes na nang umaga nang magbasa ako ng email, at doon ko nalaman na wala na si Tito Nguu. Nagkataon na ngayon lang rin nagawa ang telepono namin – na walang incoming or outgoing calls. May facebook, may text, pero bihira po akong magbukas. At marahil makukuha ninyo ‘yung joke ng nanay ko nang sinabi niya sa akin minsan – “Kumusta ang Amerika?” – kahit ang lapit lang ng UP sa Tandang Sora. Ano pa nga ba ang excuse ko sa delayed reaction ng pakikiramay?</p>

			<p>With this photo, we should like to remember a good friend and ex- FAO colleague who passed yesterday morning. Nguu Van Nguyen, PhD (extreme left in photo) was FAO’s rice expert in AGP and served as secretary of the International Rice Commission. He was also a poet, and a loving father to 3 children. He and his wife Elvira Liwag, PhD journeyed with us to start OFSPES in Rome and here in the Philippines where they settled upon retirement. We have a project group called SIKHAY where we promote food security and nutrition awareness and Elvie and Nguu are active there. Nguu you will be missed but will always be remembered. To Le Anh, Le Kim and Trina and Le Mai your father was a gentleman and a good gardener - we will miss him. Our sincere condolences from OFSPES and Sikhay and from Tina and me. May he rest in peace.</p>

That afternoon, the rain was falling nonstop; I crossed the small bridge over the creek, on my way from the Physical Science Department to the student residential quarter across the SU building. While hurriedly walking to avoid getting soaked, suddenly I heard a rather loud humming voice, in Huế’s accent, reciting a few lines in the poem “Đây Thôn Vỹ Dạ” by Hàn Mặc Tử. Below are what I heard:</p>
