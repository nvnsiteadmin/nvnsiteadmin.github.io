			<p>Most of the world will never know how much we all lost on August 4, 2021. Nguu Van Nguyen, Papa, was possibly one of the kindest, most patient, and most loving people that I’ve ever met. As I struggle through this difficult time, I am reminded of Nguu’s wisdom, “what can you do?” Luckily in this case I can share some of my experiences of Nguu.</p>

Thank you for opening the gate for us excitedly,	 for welcoming us warmly to your garden and your home, for sharing interesting stories and brilliant insights, for your gentle ways, for sharing Sikhay/Sarap moments, for introducing us to fresh outlooks and delicious possibilities in food and nutrition, and life. Mai and I, and our vibrant senior citizen group, were blessed to have spent precious moments with you and Elvie. We will always cherish those.

		<div id="excerpt">
			<p>We will sorely miss Nguu…our OFPSES and SIKHAY meetings will not be the same without him. Together with Nguu and Elvie, Tito and Lou, we have all journeyed together since the early 2007 to start OFSPES in Rome and later  in Manila which led to our starting the LSE program in Rome in 2008 for our migrants. Then when we all settled back in retirement in Manila a few years later, together with Te, Rome, Dodgie and Mai and Maris, we got introduced to the world of herbs that we had never before tasted or even heard of with such exotic names as rau ram, and kaffir lime – thanks to Nguu and Elvie through the cooking delights in their home where  they always welcomed us. They got us all hooked into discovering this whole new world of enhancing our foods while benefiting from added health and nutrition. It also started us on our adventures into cooking and trying all sorts of recipes incorporating various herbs and veggies and then into transforming these into lovely calendars that we could sell and give away as gifts. Elvie was the chef among us all, and Nguu was the master gardener who made planting seem all so easy and which inspired us to start planting our herbs and veggies as well.  He was always ready to share the seeds or seedlings that he had at home. Nguu was always the quiet one in the ever-boisterous group in our never-ending regular meetings that were more often excuses to partake of the Nguyens’ delicious concoctions than pursuing our objective of producing our not-so-annual calendars. It was Nguu however who was keen for the group to pursue and produce  a cookbook and he would say that we need not be perfectionists about it but that we should just put it together as our group’s contribution to advocating more vegetable and herb consumption in the Filipino diet.  Each time we would arrive in the Nguyen home, he would often already be waiting for us at the gate to welcome us with his warm smile. On behalf  of  OFSPES and Sikhay we will really miss Nguu and we would like to extend our deepest sympathies to Elvie, Le Anh and Francesco and the kids, Le Kim and Trina and Le Mai and family.   Incidentally I informed the FAO retirees in FB  and some  31 (mixed nationalities) would like to extend their condolences as most of them remember Nguu’s writings in the FAO Staff Coop Gazette. So Nguu,  Chin-chin, Salut, Cheers and Kampai.</p><p>Tina and Edgar</p>

			<p>Noong gabing namaalam si Nguu, naisulat ko sa twitter na “kahapon ,nabawasan ng isang mabuting tao ang mundo.” Nagulat ako sa reaksiyon sa twitter. Siguro dahil kakaunti na ang mabuting tao. Halos 100 ang naglike, maraming nagcomment at nakiramay.</p><p>Totoong mabuting tao si Nguu at nagpapasalamat ako sa Diyos na siya ang napangasawa ni Elvie. Foreigner siya pero hindi naramdaman ng pamilya ang kaibahan niya sa Filipino. Vietnamese kaya katulad ng Filipino ang panlasa sa pagkain. Matulungin siya at halos lahat kami sa  kanyang  Filipino family ay natulungan niya at binigyan ng pagkakataon.</p>

As a colleague in IITA, he expressed himself well in reports and in meetings, and his interventions were timely and assertive. He was very intelligent, sharp, clear minded and straight forward and at the same time, unassuming. He was particularly good at documenting and timely publishing of his research results.</p>

			<a href="/memories/Le_Anh"><h5 style="margin-bottom: 5px">A person who was larger than life</h5></a>
			<span style="margin-bottom: 100px">by Le Anh</span>
		</div>
		<div id="excerpt">
			<p>In so many ways, Papa feels like a person who was larger than life. He defied so many odds and in so doing raised himself out of poverty and helped his family do the same. Although he was a small man, he knew how to fill a space. His work brought him across the world and his openness and curiosity helped him experience it fully. Most of all, he had a vision of what he wanted for himself, and the temerity and singlemindedness to pursue it. He lived a unique life, and thanks to him, so did we.</p><p>Although I’ve known my father for 42 years, it’s clear that there are many parts of him that I can never truly know: his childhood in Hue, a place I have not yet even seen, his love for his friends around the world, his writing and his work, and the breadth of the social impact he has had.</p><p>But the part of him I do know well, is that of “father” and that is already a lot.</p><p>Papa was never really physically affectionate, but he was always emotionally available. Even when he was far away, he made sure to write us often and to communicated openly with us. I will also always remember our happy morning drives when I was in high school. These were moments when I had his exclusive attention. Although I don’t remember the details of our discussions, I do remember that it was a space where I could safely talk to my father about my worries and concerns. When he spoke to us, he used his words carefully, thoughtfully. I feel like Papa had a great respect for the power of words, which is why he never wasted them when talking to me.</p><p>As a parent, Papa was strict but fair. By fair, I mean he never asked of us more than what he himself was willing to do. He wanted us to be responsible, respectful, hardworking, and to live life with purpose. And he showed us how to do it through actions, and not just through words. He was a responsible parent: we were always provided for. He was a responsible husband: he did all he could to protect and safeguard Mama. He was a responsible brother: he stood by his family in Vietnam and the Philippines throughout his life. He respected his elders and expected us to do the same. And his work ethic and level of organization was unmatchable. I think this work ethic (and ways of organizing work) is the thing that I inherited from Papa. He once told me to do something that I loved so I would never really work a day in my life. I followed his advice and now every time I work, I feel like I am travelling, exploring, learning, and also creating. It doesn’t really feel like work. This perspective on work, is a gift he gave me.</p><p>He was also a <em>modern</em> dad who knew how to hold a baby, how to change diapers, how to cook.</p><p>And he could also be a lot of fun. I remember going on the hunt for worms on days he would take us fishing. I remember hunting for mushrooms. I remember him taking us swimming and for ice-cream at the IITA international house. Him cooking, him singing (with two spoons as an instrument to accompany a guitar), him gardening. I remember meeting a crocodile with Papa. I remember trips to Himlayang Pilipino and to Los Banos. I remember the pleasure he would get from simple moments and experiences. He really knew how to <em>taste</em> life. I remember the countless weekends where Papa would make barbeque, drink beer, play chess or sing songs with friends, while we kids scampered around playing with each other and when we were lucky with our very cool cousins Yumi and Manolo.</p><p>I feel a little sorry for my husband and Mai’s and happy for Trina, because Papa really set the bar high for relationships. Although he could be demanding, super makulit, and sometimes down right stubborn, what I observed in their relationship was that as a husband, Papa also was constant, loving, protective, loyal, good, and supportive. More than that, he saw Mama as an equal and even as superior in some respects. He loved her simplicity, her intellect, her creativity, and her fighting spirit. And whomever she loved, he also decided to love and support. He also loved her without condition. How could he not, he recognized from the beginning what a treasure Mama was, and he made sure that we knew it by showering her with praise when she wasn’t around. Even when they would fight passionately, Papa was always open to reconciliation. He never let pride get in the way of loving Mama. I see a lot of Papa in Kim and I also look for that in my marriage.</p><p>Finally, as the eldest, Papa had great expectation of me which were often hard to meet. His expectations were not in terms of professional or financial success (there he let me have a lot of freedom). No. He expected me to always look out for Le Kim and Le Mai. There are times when I have failed to do that, and for that I am deeply sorry. But as Papa is forgiving and constant, I know that I can brush myself off and try again each day. Papa expected me to set a good example, and again, I fail but keep trying. Papa expected me to be obedient and to support Mama (especially when he was far away for work), again, I keep working on this. As I have grown, Papa now also has a high expectation of me as a mother and a wife. He expects me to dedicate my life to my family, just as he did. Papa I am so sorry I sometimes failed to see the wisdom in your advice and words. Moving forward in life, I will try to fulfill these expectations.</p><p>Papa, thank you. You gave me so much. You remain one of the two voices in my head whenever I need light in a dark place. The other voice is the present that you gave me from day one: my Mama. All I can say is thank you. In this time I have left on this planet, I will hold you in my heart and try to always draw on all the lessons you have given me. I will also continue to try to meet your expectations. I know you are now enveloped in love, joining Grandpa, Grandma, Kuya Van, Nanay, Tito Roger, Tito Sangko, Kuya Bubot, Uncle Cu, my Lolo, and countless friends who have also experienced the great Transition. When you can, please watch over us and send us love and light when you can. For my part, I’ll make sure to still seek you out as I move forward in this life.</p><p>My children, husband, and in-laws also have some words for you. I will read them now:</p>

			<p>My dearest friend Nguu,</p><p>It was very painful getting the news that you had left us forever a couple of days ago. Since then, I have been spending my time talking about you and the good time we shared while in the UPLB with Mai, Bui Xuan and anh Brian Ngo over the phone. I also enjoyed reading the very first poem showing your love and admiration to your very dear Elvie and tributes written by our friends; those written statements really warmed my heart. I thought it would be easy to recall our precious time together, both happy and sad!- but it is rather tough thinking that this will be the last time I am talking to you, my friend Nguu!</p>

			<p>Buong maghapon akong nasa tapat ng laptop halos, nagtatapos ng mga requirements sa darating na semestre. Mag-aalas diyes na nang umaga nang magbasa ako ng email, at doon ko nalaman na wala na si Tito Nguu. Nagkataon na ngayon lang rin nagawa ang telepono namin – na walang incoming or outgoing calls. May facebook, may text, pero bihira po akong magbukas. At marahil makukuha ninyo ‘yung joke ng nanay ko nang sinabi niya sa akin minsan – “Kumusta ang Amerika?” – kahit ang lapit lang ng UP sa Tandang Sora. Ano pa nga ba ang excuse ko sa delayed reaction ng pakikiramay?</p>

			<p>With this photo, we should like to remember a good friend and ex- FAO colleague who passed yesterday morning. Nguu Van Nguyen, PhD (extreme left in photo) was FAO’s rice expert in AGP and served as secretary of the International Rice Commission. He was also a poet, and a loving father to 3 children. He and his wife Elvira Liwag, PhD journeyed with us to start OFSPES in Rome and here in the Philippines where they settled upon retirement. We have a project group called SIKHAY where we promote food security and nutrition awareness and Elvie and Nguu are active there. Nguu you will be missed but will always be remembered. To Le Anh, Le Kim and Trina and Le Mai your father was a gentleman and a good gardener - we will miss him. Our sincere condolences from OFSPES and Sikhay and from Tina and me. May he rest in peace.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/photos/Memories/Sikhay.jpg" alt="" /></p>

Tapos parang nagwork si Elvie sa IRRI and one day,  Elvie brought Nguu to the house and introduced him as her friend, who may possibly be interested in one of us.

			<p>I was so saddened by Ngưu’s passing and would like to share with you a personal moment I had of Ngưu many years ago while we were still student at UPLB.</p><p>I remember once, Ngưu in a dark vest, wandered alone by the bank of the Molawin Creek at the section running along the back of the Student Union (SU) building on campus. That afternoon, the rain was falling nonstop; I crossed the small bridge over the creek, on my way from the Physical Science Department to the student residential quarter across the SU building. While hurriedly walking to avoid getting soaked, suddenly I heard a rather loud humming voice, in Huế’s accent, reciting a few lines in the poem “Đây Thôn Vỹ Dạ” by Hàn Mặc Tử. Below are what I heard:</p>
