			<span style="margin-bottom: 100px">by Ann and Yhe</span>
		</div>
		<div id="excerpt">
			<p>Nguu is a very dear friend because his wife Elvie is. While Elvie has been a close friend for many, many years, my close encounter with Nguu began sometime in 2008 when a friend and I visited his family in Rome. We stayed with them for a few days. The warm hospitality showered on us on those few days are treasured memories: the stories we shared, the interesting places we visited, the marketing, cooking, and eating together. One thing that will always remind me of Nguu is the Vietnamese chicken he cooked and prepared for us served with chopped coriander, salt and lemon.  It was a very simple yet super-delicious dinner. In addition, when he gave us a brief tour of his office at FAO, a poster designed by their daughter, Le Anh, was on top of his desk. He raised it and proudly said that it won the best poster award.</p>

			<p>We have known Nguu for over forty-five years during our time in IRRI, IITA and even after retirement. He was truly special in so many ways. As a colleague in IITA, he expressed himself well in reports and in meetings, and his interventions were timely and assertive. He was very intelligent, sharp, clear minded and straight forward and at the same time, unassuming. He was particularly good at documenting and timely publishing of his research results.</p>

			<p>Goodbye my uncle. In Vietnam, my family always misses you. Due to the pandemic we were not able to come to you in the last moments of your life. Your memory will stay in my heart forever. Especially, I will never forget your smile every time you visited my family in Vietnam. The last time you came back to Vietnam, when Be Ha was born in Hoc Mon hospital, Be Ha also had the opportunity to see you. Please go back to your ancestors in heaven.</p>

			<p>Hoan just received an email from Mr. Dat saying that Mr. Nguu has passed on. Mr. Nguu, you andthe people you love – Mr. Vinh, Ms. Dat, Mr. Ton That Trinh – have left this world. We will no longer receive poems, short articles, that you write. Not to forget the indescribably delicious chicken cabbage salad that Hoan had eaten many times in Rome. Mr. Sam tried it over and over, still it wasn’t as delicious as you did.</p>

<p>May you rest in peace Mr. Nguu.</p>

<p>With our sincere condolences to the family,</p>

		<div id="excerpt">
			<p>I was so saddened by Ngưu’s passing and would like to share with you a personal moment I had of Ngưu many years ago while we were still student at UPLB.</p>

<p>I remember once, Ngưu in a dark vest, wandered alone by the bank of the Molawin Creek at the section running along the back of the Student Union (SU) building on campus. That afternoon, the rain was falling nonstop; I crossed the small bridge over the creek, on my way from the Physical Science Department to the student residential quarter across the SU building. While hurriedly walking to avoid getting soaked, suddenly I heard a rather loud humming voice, in Huế’s accent, reciting a few lines in the poem “Đây Thôn Vỹ Dạ” by Hàn Mặc Tử. Below are what I heard:</p>

			<p>We were deeply saddened when Ann messaged me about Nguu’s passing, 10 days ago. I thought that he was on his way to recovery from surgery. Please accept our deepest condolences for your loss.</p>

<p>Nguu was very special to me. Though we only have few conversations, I always felt that he was my true friend probably because of our love of agriculture and just the chemistry between us.</p>
