			<p>My most memorable moments with Nguu was when he and a good friend rendered a serenade to their beloved. I saw and felt Nguu’s deep love and affection for Elvie in his music. Another is that he ate his lunch with Elvie at home, not at the FAO cafeteria.</p>

			<p>Most of the world will never know how much we all lost on August 4, 2021. Nguu Van Nguyen, Papa, was possibly one of the kindest, most patient, and most loving people that I’ve ever met. As I struggle through this difficult time, I am reminded of Nguu’s wisdom, “what can you do?” Luckily in this case I can share some of my experiences of Nguu.</p>

Thank you very much, Nguu. Thank you for opening the gate for us excitedly,	 for welcoming us warmly to your garden and your home, for sharing interesting stories and brilliant insights, for your gentle ways, for sharing Sikhay/Sarap moments, for introducing us to fresh outlooks and delicious possibilities in food and nutrition, and life. Mai and I, and our vibrant senior citizen group, were blessed to have spent precious moments with you and Elvie. We will always cherish those. You enriched our lives.
You will always be fondly remembered, Nguu. We thank God for you!</p>

		<div id="excerpt">
			<p>With this photo, we should like to remember a good friend and ex- FAO colleague who passed yesterday morning. Nguu Van Nguyen, PhD (extreme left in photo) was FAO’s rice expert in AGP and served as secretary of the International Rice Commission. He was also a poet, and a loving father to 3 children. He and his wife Elvira Liwag, PhD journeyed with us to start OFSPES in Rome and here in the Philippines where they settled upon retirement. We have a project group called SIKHAY where we promote food security and nutrition awareness and Elvie and Nguu are active there. Nguu you will be missed but will always be remembered. To Le Anh, Le Kim and Trina and Le Mai your father was a gentleman and a good gardener - we will miss him. Our sincere condolences from OFSPES and Sikhay and from Tina and me. May he rest in peace.</p>

		<div id="excerpt">
			<p>Noong gabing namaalam si Nguu, naisulat ko sa twitter na “kahapon ,nabawasan ng isang mabuting tao ang mundo.” Nagulat ako sa reaksiyon sa twitter. Siguro dahil kakaunti na ang mabuting tao. Halos 100 ang naglike, maraming nagcomment at nakiramay.</p>

<p>Totoong mabuting tao si Nguu at nagpapasalamat ako sa Diyos na siya ang napangasawa ni Elvie. Foreigner siya pero hindi naramdaman ng pamilya ang kaibahan niya sa Filipino. Vietnamese kaya katulad ng Filipino ang panlasa sa pagkain. Matulungin siya at halos lahat kami sa  kanyang  Filipino family ay natulungan niya at binigyan ng pagkakataon.</p>

			<p>We have known Nguu for over forty-five years during our time in IRRI, IITA and even after retirement. He was truly special in so many ways. As a colleague in IITA, he expressed himself well in reports and in meetings, and his interventions were timely and assertive. He was very intelligent, sharp, clear minded and straight forward and at the same time, unassuming. He was particularly good at documenting and timely publishing of his research results.</p>

The last time you came back to Vietnam, when Be Ha was born in Hoc Mon hospital, Be Ha also had the opportunity to see you. Please go back to your ancestors in heaven.</p>

Mr. Sam tried it over and over, still it wasn’t as delicious as you did.</p>

			<p>My dearest friend Nguu,</p>

<p>It was very painful getting the news that you had left us forever a couple of days ago. Since then, I have been spending my time talking about you and the good time we shared while in the UPLB with Mai, Bui Xuan and anh Brian Ngo over the phone. I also enjoyed reading the very first poem showing your love and admiration to your very dear Elvie and tributes written by our friends; those written statements really warmed my heart. I thought it would be easy to recall our precious time together, both happy and sad!- but it is rather tough thinking that this will be the last time I am talking to you, my friend Nguu!</p>

			<p>Buong maghapon akong nasa tapat ng laptop halos, nagtatapos ng mga requirements sa darating na semestre. Mag-aalas diyes na nang umaga nang magbasa ako ng email, at doon ko nalaman na wala na si Tito Nguu. Nagkataon na ngayon lang rin nagawa ang telepono namin – na walang incoming or outgoing calls. May facebook, may text, pero bihira po akong magbukas. At marahil makukuha ninyo ‘yung joke ng nanay ko nang sinabi niya sa akin minsan – “Kumusta ang Amerika?” – kahit ang lapit lang ng UP sa Tandang Sora. Ano pa nga ba ang excuse ko sa delayed reaction ng pakikiramay?</p>

Tapos parang nagwork si Elvie sa IRRI and one day,  Elvie brought Nguu to the house and introduced him as her friend, who may possibly be interested in one of us.

			<p>I was so saddened by Ngưu’s passing and would like to share with you a personal moment I had of Ngưu many years ago while we were still student at UPLB.</p>

<p>I remember once, Ngưu in a dark vest, wandered alone by the bank of the Molawin Creek at the section running along the back of the Student Union (SU) building on campus. That afternoon, the rain was falling nonstop; I crossed the small bridge over the creek, on my way from the Physical Science Department to the student residential quarter across the SU building. While hurriedly walking to avoid getting soaked, suddenly I heard a rather loud humming voice, in Huế’s accent, reciting a few lines in the poem “Đây Thôn Vỹ Dạ” by Hàn Mặc Tử. Below are what I heard:</p>
