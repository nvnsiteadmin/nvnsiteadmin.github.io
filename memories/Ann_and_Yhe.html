<p>Nguu is a very dear friend because his wife Elvie is. While Elvie has been a close friend for many, many years, my close encounter with Nguu began sometime in 2008 when a friend and I visited his family in Rome. We stayed with them for a few days. The warm hospitality showered on us on those few days are treasured memories: the stories we shared, the interesting places we visited, the marketing, cooking, and eating together. One thing that will always remind me of Nguu is the Vietnamese chicken he cooked and prepared for us served with chopped coriander, salt and lemon.  It was a very simple yet super-delicious dinner. In addition, when he gave us a brief tour of his office at FAO, a poster designed by their daughter, Le Anh, was on top of his desk. He raised it and proudly said that it won the best poster award.</p>

<p>When they moved back to the Philippines, we see them every so often and each time Nguu would warmly hug to welcome us and then eagerly lead us to a tour of his garden. His devotion and dedication to his wife, children, and friends will always be remembered.</p>

<p>Thank you, Nguu, for being a gracious friend. You will always remain in our hearts.</p>

<p>— Ann</p>

<p>My most memorable moments with Nguu was when he and a good friend rendered a serenade to their beloved. I saw and felt Nguu’s deep love and affection for Elvie in his music. Another is that he ate his lunch with Elvie at home, not at the FAO cafeteria.</p>
