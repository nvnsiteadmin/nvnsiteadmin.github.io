<p>Dear quy anh chi who had, just like me, shared an unforgettable part of your lives with our very dear friend Nguu, It was very painful when learning the unexpected news last night. Nevertheless, I would like to celebrate Nguu’s life by sharing our personal experiences/feelings about spending time with Nguu as anh Sam just did.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>For me, I treasure the moments we shared when still attending graduate study at UPLB. We looked forward to spending a good time together at Eveland Billiard then having a couple of San Miguel beers at Dalampasigan across the street.</p>

<p>I spent time with Nguu when Le Van- his first child passed. I shared his deep pain, thus unable to sleep for a while. When Nguu was still working for PhilRice, I always made a point to visit his family in Quezon city whenever I had free time- taking the LTB bus for 65 km then a couple of Jeepney rides. My riding time never got wasted because we always enjoyed our time together with great conversation, singing, good food and San Miguel. Before Nguu and I moved away from the Philippines, I shared the joy and excitement of Nguu &amp; his family watching the births and growing up of all his children: Le Anh, Le Kim and Le Mai. They are all successful grownups now: Nguu must be very proud of them all!</p>

<p>Finally, I would like to respect the privacy of Elvie at this very painful moment, hence won’t include her name among the recipients.</p>
