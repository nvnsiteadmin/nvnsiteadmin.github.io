<div id="page-content">
<p>Our heartfelt goodbye to you dear Nguu!  We won’t forget you dear friend!  With every bowl of rice, every cold beer, every walk in the garden path, we will remember you!</p>

<!--more-->

<p>For the past many years, when we went home to the Philippines before the pandemic, we always looked forward to the joint birthday celebration of Nesty and friend Rene, that you so kindly hosted annually. And when the Legion barkada arrived, you would be there by your front gate Nguu, with your welcoming, happy smile, while Elvie would still be busy putting finishing touches to the sumptuous spread waiting for us. Naturally, everything would be attractively presented, delicious, and healthy.  And then there would be our endless chatter, laughter, jokes and singing.  Remember?  And who can forget your special improvised “spoon-on-spoon” musical instrument that you so deftly played?  How about the Vietnamese love song you would sing expressively to Elvie while playing and tapping the guitar? That was awesome!</p>

<p>And Nguu, what Nesty remembers most was the yummy, mouth watering shredded chicken and cabbage paired with nouc nam that you concocted - and of course served with a cold drink!  How Nesty reminisces too about your jamming sessions with you and Vio - and wherein you would request for them to sing your twin love songs for Elvie -“Dahil sa Isang Bulaklak and You My Love”?  Who can forget that?</p>

<p>So Nguu, thanks for the happy memories!  You were a gifted, talented person, a hard working loving family man whom we admired and chose to be the “Ninong’ of our daughter Marissa and son-in-law Chris at their wedding.<br />
Yes, we love you Nguu for the compassionate and passionate man that you were.  We love you for being a true and loyal friend for almost 5 decades, but we love you most for being the ever-loving and caring husband to our closest and dearest friend, Elvie.</p>

<p>Rest in God’s embrace, dear Nguu.</p>
