<div id="page-content">
<p>We are all Math teachers teaching at the Department of Math, Stat, and Physics in UP Los Banos except for Es who is a researcher at the Forestry Research Institute. We were living in the same house. There were  nine of us (Elvie, Lou, Edna, Vicky, Cecile, Es, Dulce, Cita (Dulce’s younger sister), and myself. Tapos parang nagwork si Elvie sa IRRI and one day,  Elvie brought Nguu to the house and introduced him as her friend, who may possibly be interested in one of us. It turned out Nguu is interested in Elvie and vice versa.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Lou, Es, and Elvie were about five years  or more older than us and I look up to them as Ate (older sister). Ang saya namin sa bahay we were like family although our personalities are really varied to say the least. I remembered, I got two major advises from Elvie – huwag magboyfriend ng estudyante at huwag pipili ng bobo. So, I kept those two advises to my heart.  And when Elvie finally told us that Nguu is already her boyfriend, I measured Nguu based sa turo ni Elvie, ang naisip ko super talino si Nguu dahil pinili siya ni Elvie at kahit estudyante pa lang sa kanyang PhD ay Searca Scholar naman kaya nakapasa siya kay Elvie.</p>

<p>Nguu is friendly and genuine, at ease siya agad sa amin. I remembered iyong first dinner niya with us, medyo nagulat kami kasi pinuno niya ng malabundok na kanin iyong plato niya, as in konti na lang ang space para sa ibang food. Tapos sa lunch naman, lumalabas siya ng bahay para manguha ng mga wild plants doon sa vacant lot dahil kinakain daw iyon sa Vietnam. He is not afraid to show who he is – someone from a farming/rural background.</p>

<p>Nguu accepted us all as his friends too. As a young couple then, we are always welcome sa Searca townhouse nila. Parating pwede kaming magdinner doon at may kasama pang balut. I think pareho sila ni Elvie na mahilig sa balut. Then, we lost touch, and after several years met again as a sort of reunion in their house at Tierra Bella, they have 2 children at that time, and Nguu was working in Munoz at Phil Rice while Elvie was In UP, in that reunion, I appreciated when Nguu played long playing records of our group’s favorite songs way back in our Los Banos Days.</p>

<p>Come year 2000 and onwards, Elvie and I communicated from time to time through email. Then Nguu retired from FAO as an officer, and they settled in the Philippines. So, nagkikita kits na naman kami from time to time at ang dahilan ay ang aming mga munting advocacies o kaya pag may umuuwi galing sa abroad, like si Dulce, Lou, or si Edna. Si Nguu ay may book tungkol sa rice. I remembered him telling us that he visited about 99 rice producing countries all over the world. Si Elvie naman ay may book on cooking and calendar of recipes using organic vegetables and fruits and is involved with the OFW community in Rome. Kami naman (ni Ed) may advocacy sa Marikina made shoes. I remembered nang wala kaming mapagdalhan ng shoe stocks, Nguu offered that we can make use of one of their rooms.  Customers ko sila ng wallets at shoes na pinapasalubong nila sa Vietnam at customer din nila ako ng kanilang 12 month health food calendar. So masaya na naman kami pag nagkikita kita kami sa bahay nila Nguu at Elvie. We usually have lunch there Tapos lilipat kami sa bahay namin para magkape pero dala dala namin ang tanglad at iba pang leaves na galing sa garden nila Elvie, mga tanim ni Nguu, for tea. Our group has expanded to include our husbands too. Our friendships dates way back when we were in our 20s, when we are just being initiated into the struggles of adulthood and the responsibilities of family life.</p>

<p>To Nguu, kami ni Ed will visit Elvie, kasama sina Romie at Es, sa bahay ninyo pagkatapos ng ECQ. Wala ka na but your spirit will be there, we know, and we will pray together for you. Edna, will include you in their daily zoom rosary for 40 days in time for your final travel to heaven.</p>

<p>To Nguu, you lived a colorful, successful and healthy life with a wonderful family. You have shown to God our Creator, your goodness and faithfulness through your family, your work, and to us your friends. Be at peace with God in heaven. Maraming Salamat Nguu, we are honored to be your friend. Till we meet again.</p>
