</div>

<div id="page-content">
<p>Oh Hue, let’s say farewell.<br />
Months and years of tender childhood,<br />
And the rapidly passing teenage years,<br />
Hue had cuddled, Hue had embraced me,<br />
With the clean and fresh water of Huong Giang,<br />
With songs and sounds of kite flutes, of rustling pine trees<br />
Mixed with the sound of the ho from the ferries. <br />
Truong Tien Bridge filled with ao dai Dong Khanh girls, <br />
On the way back home in the afternoon, pedaling,<br />
Then in the cool autumn evenings<br />
No one tell, but steps increased in speed,<br />
And the long winter days with north wind drizzles.<br />
The bitter cold, freezes one’s feet,<br />
Would pass though slowly, as they might<br />
Return to Hue, the blue sky,<br />
With birdsongs and blooming flowers of spring,<br />
Then summer arrives Phuong flowers reddened the walking paths,<br />
Of Quoc Hoc campus.</p>

<p>Tell me Hue, to never forget<br />
Le Loi, Dong Ba, Gia Hoi,<br />
And the small quarter that gets flooded every year,<br />
Even ill-fitting shirts were difficult to obtain<br />
they protect me from the strong cold winds. <br />
In winter afternoons,<br />
On the banks of Huong Giang, alone waiting <br />
For the sound of Father’s boat, arriving<br />
Or the evening, under the thatch roof, longing<br />
For Mother, from the market returning,<br />
Why does it close so late?<br />
For anxiety filled my young, whole heart ,<br />
Tell me Hue, please tell me<br />
Huong Giang, will water be ever clear and fresh<br />
So, the Dong Cat Fish up the river to reach Dai Dau<br />
Make the evening meal delicious?</p>

<p>Tell me Hue, please tell me<br />
One should hurry<br />
So as not to miss the Trung Tien Bridge<br />
At the appointed time for the date<br />
At Van Lau gate<br />
So that there would be no heart broken.\</p>

<p>Do say farewell.<br />
Promised not to be sad.<br />
But why would tears run in creases<br />
When gray clouds fall on the way to the airport?</p>
